    "#Ans\n",
    "MongoDB is a popular document-oriented NoSQL database that stores data \n",
    "in a flexible, semi-structured JSON-like format called BSON. \n",
    "It is designed to handle large volumes of unstructured data and \n",
    "provide fast, scalable, and highly available data storage and retrieval.\n",
    "\n",
    "Non-relational databases, also known as NoSQL databases, are a class \n",
    "of databases that do not use the traditional relational data model used \n",
    "in SQL databases. They offer a more flexible data model that allows for \n",
    "storing and querying unstructured and semi-structured data, such as documents,\n",
    "graphs, and key-value pairs. NoSQL databases typically offer horizontal scaling \n",
    "and high availability features that are important for modern applications that \n",
    "need to handle large amounts of data and high traffic loads.\n",
    "\n",
    "MongoDB is preferred over SQL databases in scenarios where:\n",
    "    \n",
    "1-Large volumes of unstructured or semi-structured data need to be stored and \n",
    "retrieved quickly and efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "2-Flexibility is needed to change data models as requirements change over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "3-High availability and horizontal scaling are required for handling large\n",
    "numbers of concurrent users and high traffic loads.\n",
    "\n",
    "4-Agile development practices are used, as MongoDB's document-oriented \n",
    "approach allows for faster and more flexible application development.\n",
    "\n",
    "5-Real-time data analytics and business intelligence are required, as MongoDB's\n",
    "aggregation framework provides powerful tools for querying and analyzing data.\n",
    "\n",
